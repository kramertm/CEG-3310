    1.  cache size / cache block size = # of caches
        if it says two way or any number way then split above number of cache blocks into the number of ways
        total length of memory address is what is says on exam 
        offset is size of each cache in binary EX. 16 bytes per cache the offset = 4 because 2^4 is 16
        index is for which cache block its going to so if theres 4 caches the index is 2 bits, if 2 caches then 1 bits
        index if its more than one way is then which set of caches EX. two way the index would be 1 bit
        tag is whats left over
        total bits of tag = tag * # of cache blocks
        
    2.  write out cache and map to cache and array element's for all iterations first
        then go step by step through loop
        when doing the problem a = b + c 
        it goes b -> c -> a when checking for hit or miss
        hit ratio is hits / (hits + misses)
        then itll probs ask for you to write out final contents of caches

    3.  look at the bit responsible for the cache block number from problem 1.1
        if the last number on the hex address matches then hit else miss
        if two way or more way 1 sorta acts like a spill ove for way 0

2.
    1.  not interleaved miss penalty = address sent to DRAM + (DRAM latency + data over bus) * (cache block size / bus memory size)
        interleaved miss penalty = address sent to DRAM + DRAM latency * (cache block size / banks) + cache block size
        Bus cycles to CPU cycles is (processor speed / bus speed) then multiply bus cycles miss penalty by that 
    2.  CPI = CPI when no cache miss is considered + (I-cache miss ratio + chance for instruction to access D-cache * D-cache miss ratio) * miss penalty from 2.1 in CPU cycles
    3.  (number it gave in question * answer from 2.2) / processor speed
    4.  calculate the new miss penalty in terms of CPU cycles see 2.1
